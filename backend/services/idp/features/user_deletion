Feature: User Deletion
  As an administrator
  I want to delete users
  So that I can remove unused accounts

  Scenario: Successfully delete a user
    Given I am an authenticated administrator
    And a user exists with email "john@email.com"
    When I delete the user
    Then the user should be deleted successfully
    And I should not be able to find the user by email "john@email.com"

  Scenario: Delete non-existent user
    Given I am an authenticated administrator
    When I try to delete a user with id "non-existent-id"
    Then I should see an error "User not found"
