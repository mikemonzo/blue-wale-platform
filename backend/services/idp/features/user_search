Feature: User Search
  As an administrator
  I want to search for users
  So that I can find specific user accounts

  Scenario: Search users by email pattern
    Given I am an authenticated administrator
    And the following users exist:
      | email           | username | first_name |
      | john@email.com | johndoe  | John       |
      | jane@email.com | janedoe  | Jane       |
    When I search for users with email containing "john"
    Then I should see 1 user in the results
    And the result should include "john@email.com"

  Scenario: Search users with pagination
    Given I am an authenticated administrator
    And there are 25 users in the system
    When I request page 1 with 10 users per page
    Then I should see 10 users in the results
    And I should see pagination metadata with total count 25
